* Installing Gdrive

In order to use Google API, you will need to:

#+begin_src markdown
1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/ and create a new project for yourself
2. Search for the **Google Drive API** in the search box at the top, and click manage this app
3. Click `OAuth` consent screen on the left and set it up.
    - Assuming your account isn't part of an organization, you'll have to say your app is for external users and in testing
    - In the required scopes section, add **.../auth/docs** and **.../auth/drive** (I'm not sure which needed, it's probably only one of those). This will probably not be available if you didn't complete (2)
    - Add the accounts you want to use with your copy of gdrive as testers of your app. Only these accounts will be able to use your copy
of gdrive, so everyone will have to compile their own (unless someone
goes and gets theirs reviewed by Google)
4. Click Credentials on the left, then Create Credentials, then OAuth client ID. The application type is Desktop app
5. Copy the Client ID and Secret into handlers_drive.go lines 17 and 18 and compile the application
#+end_src

---------

#+begin_src bash
mkdir -p ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive.git && cd gdrive
#+end_src

Copy the ~Client ID~ and ~Secret~ into ~handlers_drive.go~ lines 17 and 18 and compile the application.

*Note:* Generated token expires in 7 days.

Finally:
- https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
  ~PUBLISH APP~

** Build

Open terminal and go to the folder where the ~handerls_drive.go~ is.

#+begin_src bash
cd ~/git/gdrive
rm -f ~/.gdrive/token_v2.json  # delete the old token
go env -w GO111MODULE=auto
go get github.com/prasmussen/gdrive  # go install github.com/prasmussen/gdrive@latest
go build -ldflags "-w -s"
sudo cp gdrive /usr/local/bin/gdrive
./gdrive about
#+end_src

Go to the following URL in your browser:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=...

And paste it into your console next to: ~Enter verification code:~

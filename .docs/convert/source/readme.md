# ebloc-broker

`eBlocBroker` is a smart contract as an autonomous volunteer computing and sharing data resource broker based on blockchain for e-Science.
It applies blockchain technology to provide a market for computational and data resources to research communities.


For more info see: [documentation](https://ebloc-broker-readthedocs.duckdns.org/).

## Prerequisites
 * [Slurm](https://github.com/SchedMD/slurm),
[IPFS](https://ipfs.io),
[eth-brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie),
[owncloud/pyocclient](https://github.com/owncloud/pyocclient),
[prasmussen/gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive),
[ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache).

## Using Docker

You can use a sandbox container provided in the [./docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file for testing inside a Docker
environment.

This container provides everything you need to test using a `Python 3.7` interpreter. Start the test environment:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To enter the shell of the running container in the interactive mode, run:
```
docker exec --detach-keys="ctrl-e,e" -it ebloc-broker_slurm_1 /bin/bash
```

To stop the container, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Cloud Storages

## How to install required packages

We have a helper script, which you can use to install all required external dependencies:

```

Next, type `eblocbroker --help` for basic usage information.

## Requester

### Submit Job

In order to submit your job each user should already registered into eBlocBroker using `eblocbroker register_provider ~/.ebloc-broker/cfg.yaml`
After registration is done, each user should authenticate their ORCID iD using the following [http://ebloc-broker-authenticate.duckdns.org/index.php](http://ebloc-broker-authenticate.duckdns.org/index.php) using [Brave](https://brave.com) browser along with [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).

```bash
$ eblocbroker submit job.yaml
```

#### Example yaml file in order to define a job to submit.

`job.yaml` :
```yaml
config:
  requester_address: '0x378181ce7b07e8dd749c6f42772574441b20e35f'
  provider_address: '0x29e613b04125c16db3f3613563bfdd0ba24cb629'
  source_code:
    storage_id: ipfs
    cache_type: public
    path: ~/test_eblocbroker/run_cppr
    storage_hours: 0
  data:
    data1:
      hash: 4613abc322e8f2fdeae9a5dd10f17540
    data2:
      hash: 050e6cc8dd7e889bf7874689f1e1ead6
    data3:
      cache_type: public
      path: /home/alper/test_eblocbroker/small/BVZ-venus
      storage_hours: 1
      storage_id: ipfs
  data_transfer_out: 10
  jobs:
    job1:
      cores: 1
      run_time: 60
```

 * `path` should represented as full path of the corresponding folder.
 * `cache_type` should be variable from [ `public`, `private` ]
 * `storage_id` should be variable from [ `ipfs`, `ipfs_gpg`, `none`, `b2drop`, `gdrive` ]

--------------------------------------

## Provider
Each provider should run `eblocbroker driver` for start running the Python script.

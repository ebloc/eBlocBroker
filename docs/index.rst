Welcome to eBlocBroker's documentation!
================================================
Recently, peer-to-peer based blockchain infrastructures have emerged as disruptive technologies and have lead to the realization of crypto-currencies and smart contracts that can used in a globally trustless manner. The Ethereum eBlocBroker is a blockchain based autonomous computational resource broker.

The service is completely trustless, meaning that the entire broke service operates
as smart contracts on the Ethereum private blockchain, with no priviledged access given
to any party.

Code can be viewed on the `github repository`_.  

If you are a smart contract developer and would like to start submitting
jobs now then check out the :doc:`./quickstart`.

## How to use eBlocBroker inside an Amazon EC2 Instance


An Amazon image (**AMI Name:** `eBloc`, **AMI ID:** `ami-f5c47f8a`) is also available that contains
`geth` setup to connect to our Ethereum based private proof-of-authority blockchain network (*eBlocPOA*).

### Create an Ethereum Account

**Creating an account:**

```bash
$ cd eBlocPOA
$ eblocPath="$PWD"
$ geth --datadir="$eblocPath" account new
Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password. Do not forget this password.
Passphrase:
Repeat passphrase:
Address: {a0a50a64cac0744dea5287d1025b8ef28aeff36e}
```

Your new account is locked with a password. Please give a password.
Do not forget this password. Please enter a difficult passphrase for your account.

You should see your `Keystore File (UTC / JSON)`under `keystore` directory.

```bash
[~/eBlocPOA]$ ls keystore
UTC--2018-02-14T10-46-54.423218000Z--a0a50a64cac0744dea5287d1025b8ef28aeff36e
```

**On the console, use:**

You can also create your Ethereum account inside your `geth-client`. Here your Keystore File` will
be created with root permission, `eBlocWallet` will not able to unlock it.

```bash
> personal.newAccount()
Passphrase:
Repeat passphrase:
"0x7d334606c71417f944ff8ba5c09e3672066244f8"
> eth.accounts
["0x7d334606c71417f944ff8ba5c09e3672066244f8"]
```

Now you should see your `Keystore File (UTC / JSON)` under `private/keystore` directory.

```bash
[~/eBlocPOA]$ ls private/keystore
UTC--2018-02-14T11-00-59.995395000Z--7d334606c71417f944ff8ba5c09e3672066244f8
```

To give open acccess to the keystore file:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) private/keystore/UTC--...
```

- Afterwards, open the following file: `$HOME/eBlocBroker/.profile` and set `COINBASE` with your
  created Ethereum Address.

-------

Later, please do following inside your Amazon instance.

```bash
# To run eBloc Etheruem Node
$ eblocServer

# To run eBlocBroker Driver
$ cd $HOME/eBlocBroker
$ bash initialize.sh # do it only once
$ sudo ./Driver.sh
```

## Start Running Cluster using eBlocBroker

### Cluster Side: How to register a cluster

Please note the following:

- If you do not have any `Federated Cloud ID` give an empty string: `""`. You can
  use `./registerCluster.py` to submit your jobs.

```bash
coreNumber         = 128;
clusterEmail       = "ebloc@gmail.com";
federationCloudId  = "ee14ea28-b869-1036-8080-9dbd8c6b1579@b2drop.eudat.eu";
corePriceMinuteWei = 100;
ipfsID             = "/ip4/79.123.177.145/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmWmZQnb8xh3gHf9ZFmVQC4mLEav3Uht5kHJxZtixG3rsf";

./registerCluster.py $coreNumber $clusterEmail $federationCloudId $corePriceMinuteWei $ipfsID
```

- A Python daemon program called *Driver* is responsible for facilitating the communication between
  the eBlocBroker smart contract and the Slurm resource manager. After the cluster is registered
  please run: `./Driver.py`

<!---
### Slurm Setup:
Slurm should run on the background. Please run:

```bash
sudo ./bash_scripts/run_slurm.sh
```

Following example should successfully submit the job:

```bash
cd eBlocBroker/slurmJobExample
sbatch -N1 run.sh
Submitted batch job 1
```
-->

------------------------------

### Client Side: How to obtain IPFS Hash of the job:

It is important that first you should run IPFS daemon on the background: `ipfs daemon &`. If it is
not running, cluster is not able to get the IPFS object from the client's node.

Example code could be seen under `eBlocBroker/slurmJobExample` directory:

Client should put his Slurm script inside a file called `run.sh`. Please note that you do not have
to identify `-n` and `-t` parameters, since they will be overwritten with arguments provided by the
client on the cluster end

Target into the folder you want to submit and do: `ipfs add -r .` You will see something similiar with following output:

```bash
added QmYsUBd5F8FA1vcUsMAHCGrN8Z92TdpNBAw6rMxWwmQeMJ simpleSlurmJob/helloworld.cpp
added QmbTzBprmFEABAWwmw1VojGLMf3nv7Z16eSgec55DYdbiX simpleSlurmJob/run.sh
added QmXsCmg5jZDvQBYWtnAsz7rukowKJP3uuDuxfS8yXvDb8B simpleSlurmJob
```

- Main folder's IPFS hash (for example:`QmWmyoMoctfbAaiEs2G46gpeUmhqFRDW6KWo64y5r581Vd`) would be
  used as key to the submitted `jobKey` to the `eBlocBroker` by the client.

#### **How to return available Clusters Addresses**

```bash
./getClusterAddresses.py
```

-----------

### **How to Submit a Job**

In order to submit your job each user should already registered into eBlocBroker.You can use `./registerUser.py` to register. Please update followin arguments inside `registerUser.py` file.

`account`, `userEmail`, `federationCloudID`, and `ipfsAddress`.

After registiration is done, each user should authenticate their ORCID iD using the following
[link](http://ebloc.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/orcid-authentication/index.php).

-----------

Later, you can use `./submit_job.py` to submit your jobs.

#### **1. How to submit a job using IPFS**

Please update following arguments inside `submit_job.py` file.


```python
clusterAddress  = "0x4e4a0750350796164D8DefC442a712B7557BF282"
ipfsHash        = "QmefdYEriRiSbeVqGvLx15DKh4WqSMVL8nT4BwvsgVZ7a5"
coreNum         = 1;
coreGasDay      = 0
coreGasHour     = 0
coreGasMin      = 10
gasBandwidthIn  = 100
gasBandwidthOut = 100
storageType     = 0 # Please note that '0' stands for IPFS repository share.
```

#### **2. How to submit a job using EUDAT**

Before doing this you have to be sure that you have shared your folder with cluster's FID. Please
[follow](https://github.com/avatar-lavventura/someCode/issues/4). Otherwise your job will not be
accepted. Please update following arguments inside `submit_job.py` file.

```python
clusterAddress  = "0x4e4a0750350796164D8DefC442a712B7557BF282"
jobKey          = "folderName"
coreNum         = 1
coreGasDay      = 0
coreGasHour     = 0
coreGasMin      = 10
gasBandwidthIn  = 100
gasBandwidthOut = 100
storageType     = 1 # Please note that '1' stands for EUDAT repository share.
```

#### **3. How to submit a job using IPFS with GPG**

Please update following arguments inside `submit_job.py` file.

```python
clusterID       = "0x4e4a0750350796164D8DefC442a712B7557BF282" # clusterID you would like to submit.
jobKey          = "QmefdYEriRiSbeVqGvLx15DKh4WqSMVL8nT4BwvsgVZ7a5"
coreNum         = 1
coreGasDay      = 0
coreGasHour     = 0
coreGasMin      = 10
gasBandwidthIn  = 100
gasBandwidthOut = 100
storageType     = 2 # Please note 2 stands for IPFS with GPG repository share.
```

#### **4. How to submit a job using Google-Drive**

##### [gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive) install:

```bash
$ go get github.com/prasmussen/gdrive
$ gopath=$(go env | grep 'GOPATH' | cut -d "=" -f 2 | tr -d '"')
$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$gopath/bin' >> ~/.profile
$ source .profile
$ gdrive about # This line authenticates the user only once on the same node.
Authentication needed
Go to the following url in your browser:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=offline&client_id=...e=state
Enter verification code:
```

First you have to share your folder with the cluster:

```bash
folderPath='/home/prc/multiple/workingTestIpfs'
folderName='ipfs'
clusterToShare='aalimog1@binghamton.edu'
gdrive upload --recursive $folderPath/$folderName
jobKey=$(gdrive list | grep $folderName | awk '{print $1}')
echo $jobKey # This is jobKey
gdrive share $jobKey  --role writer --type user --email $clusterToShare
```

If your work is compressed under folder name such as `folder_path/folderName,/RUN.zip`; please name it
`RUN.zip` or `RUN.tar.gz`.

---------

Please update following arguments inside `submit_job.py` file.

```python
clusterID       = "0xda1e61e853bb8d63b1426295f59cb45a34425b63" # clusterID you would like to submit.
jobKey          = "1-R0MoQj7Xfzu3pPnTqpfLUzRMeCTg6zG" # Please write file-Id of the uploaded file
coreNum         = 1
coreGasDay      = 0
coreGasHour     = 0
coreGasMin      = 10
gasBandwidthIn  = 100
gasBandwidthOut = 100
storageType     = 4 # Please note that 4 stands for gdrive repository share.
```

### **How to Obtain Submitted Job's Information:**

You can use `./getJobInfo.py` to submit your jobs.

```bash
clusterID = "0x4e4a0750350796164D8DefC442a712B7557BF282" # clusterID that you have submitted your job.
jobKey    = "6a6783e74a655aad01bf2d1202362685"
index     = 0
./getJobInfo.py $clusterID $jobKey $index
```

- Status of the job could be `QUEUED`, `REFUNDED`, `RUNNING`, `PENDING`, or `COMPLETED`.

-----------

### Events

#### Keep track of logged received jobs and their status

```bash
clusterAddress="0x57b60037b82154ec7149142c606ba024fbb0f991"
